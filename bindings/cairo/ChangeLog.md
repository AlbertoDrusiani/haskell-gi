### 1.0.17

+ Add an override for [`Cairo.Matrix`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-cairo/docs/GI-Cairo-Structs-Matrix.html): it is a boxed type, but it was not properly annotated as such in the introspection data.

### 1.0.16

+ Enable override for cairo/FontOptions, due to wrong cairo-1.0.gir file
