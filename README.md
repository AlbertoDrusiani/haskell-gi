haskell-gi
==========

Haskell bindings for GObject Introspection, based on the code in
http://git.rhydd.org/?p=haskell-gi;a=summary
and
https://gitorious.org/haskell-gi
and some portions of gtk2hs.

This version adds support for type conversions between different
GObject derived instances and connecting callbacks to signals.
