### 0.20.1

+ gtk-doc parser and haddock generator: while no means perfect,
now the autogenerated bindings come with some reasonable
autogenerated documentation.

+ Many bugfixes. A particularly important one is for
[issue 82](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/82), which
made compilation of
[gi-glib](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-glib) fail, for
the latest version of gobject-introspection.
